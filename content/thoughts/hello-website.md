## Welcome!

Welcome to my website. Over the years, many different sites created by me have
lived at this domain. This is the new one, and who knows how long it will be
here. It is different from the previous ones, which mostly served as a way to
prove to potential employers that I could indeed write code. Now that I have,
and have a job :-), this is more to serve as my personal home on the web;
although I imagine at some point my resume and some projects I have created will
end up here.

In general, I don't consider this a blog, though I suppose as far as
Merriam-Webster is concerned,[^1] it is. Blogs seem to be more cohesive and
serious than I expect this to be. I've called these entries "thoughts" instead
of "blog posts" because one of my goals with this is to exercise my brain in
whatever way is interesting in that moment, and document it here as a record to
myself. If you happen to find that helpful, interesting, or compelling in any
other way, wonderful!

## Why?

I have been thinking about the sheer _volume_[^2] of the internet recently, and
the nature of content[^3] that presents itself to me instead of being sought
after. It seems like every website is screaming to try and win my attention, and
I'm tired of playing that game. In an effort to combat that I am going to try
writing longer form, more meaningul things that are of interest to me instead of
shouting into the Algorithm and hoping that people take notice.

There's loads of things wrong with the internet[^4] today: systems designed to
be addictive, a million ways to satisfy our desire for instant gratification,
search that _doesn't work_.[^5] All of which, drive me to be a less fulfilled
and peaceful person.

This webpage is one of many alternatives I am trying to and/or have introduced
into my life. In tandem with posting this first thought, I am listing these
alternatives and their reasonings [here](/alternatives).

It's important that this website, and all those other alternatives, are not in
some hustle-based effort to grind into some uber-successful,
productivity-pilled, super human. In fact, my hope is the opposite. I hope, and
have seen over the past few months, that these things help me to live a quieter,
more content, and simpler life. Many, if not all, of these things will demand
cost of some sort; be it monetary, convenience, social, etc.

## A preview of what is to come

Some things I want to eventually write about and don't want to forget:

-   Getting a library card
-   My experience with wildlife photography, my camera, and Gear Aquisition
    Syndrome
-   A maple mead (acerglyn[^6]) I made, but I have to taste and bottle it to
    reach my conclusions
-   Cooking with intuition
-   Hiking by yourself, without music or a podcast
-   Why I love the Community finale[^7]

    Ugh, I hate that word. Here I am referring to things like, but not limited
    to, YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, headline-driven articles. Basically anything
    consumed on the internet.

    and probably society as well, likely due in part to the condition of the
    internet

    Looking at you, YouTube. I may write about this later, as well as some other
    observations from the internet. Though I feel like this is pretty well
    covered elsewhere, so unless I decide I have something to add I may not.

    About six months ago this actually made me try making this site the last
    time. I didn't end up following through, but it is what got me thinking
    about writing.
