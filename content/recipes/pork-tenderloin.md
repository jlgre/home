Pan seared pork tenderloin with a shallot pan sauce. 3-4 servings.

## Ingredients

-   **Pork tenderloin**: I usually but the two-pack of fully intact tenderloins
    at the store, which serves my wife and I for one night and then we have
    leftovers the next.
-   **Onion**: White, yellow, shallot, whatever.
-   **Sauce base**: I tend to use whatever wine is open. White or red is fine, a
    barrel aged spirit (like bourbon or cognac) would work too.
-   **Sauce augments**: Mustard, worcestershire sauce, demi-glace, etc.
-   **Butter**: Just some butter, cold.

## Directions

1. Trim the pork. The main thing to find is the silver skin and make sure you
   get it off because it is _incredibly_ chewy.
1. Sear the pork in a oven-safe pan over medium-high (on my stove at least)
   until there's a nice crust all around it.
1. Transfer to a 300 degree oven until it reaches 145 inside. Pull it out to a
   plate to rest while making the sauce.
1. Return the pan to the stove top (careful, it is _so_ hot even on the handle
   now) and boil out any water in it. Once done sautee the onion and deglaze
   with whatever liquid you're using. If not wine, you'll want to add something
   acidic with it (mustard, vinegar, something).
1. Reduce for a while.
1. Mount with cold butter off heat to emulsify.
1. Slice pork into rounds and serve with sauce spooned over the top.
