Grilled wings coated in a sticky honey-sriracha glaze. 2 servings. Really great
with [grilled brussels sprouts](../grilled-brussles).

## Ingredients

-   **Chicken wings**: I just buy the big pack of whole wings (drumstick and
    flat still together). Expect to use about 8 of them.
-   **Honey**: I dunno - eyeball it.
-   **Sriracha**: I dunno - eyeball it.
-   **Soy sauce**: I dunno - eyeball it, but don't skimp. Its the only source of
    salt.

## Directions

1. Separate the wings into three parts: the drumstick, the flat, and that other
   piece. Use that other piece to make chicken stock to use later[^1].
1. Cook them: I typically cook in a 300 degree oven until 165 or a little
   higher[^2].
1. Above steps can be done up to a couple days in advance, or freeze and have
   them ready to go later.
1. Mix up honey, sriracha, and soy sauce to make glaze.
1. Get the grill going - I like charcoal. Make the fire pretty hot.
1. Grill the cooked chicken, start by trying to get color and crisp on them.
1. Start to shellac them with layers of the sauce until sticky, crispy, and warm
   all the way through.

    Seriously, while prepping the other stuff start a stock with the trimmings.

    This is just about making the chicken safe to eat - flavor and texture and
    everything else comes later.
