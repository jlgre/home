    <p>Here are some things I am trying to stop using, why, and what I&rsquo;ve replaced them

reasons, or privacy reasons. I am not claiming that this is the perfect way to

<h2 id="social-media">Social Media</h2>
<h3 id="instagram">Instagram</h3>
<p>In its infancy, Instagram was pretty cool and was a fun way to see photos of
what your friends were doing. Now it is some weird combination of
Algorithm-served short videos designed to grab my attention, and the rare post
from a friend from a week ago.</p>
<p>I use(d) Instagram for two very different puposes. I have a wildlife photography
account that serves as a portfolio of sorts, and I have a personal accout that
had the goal of keeping up with my friends. I will have two different sections
of alternatives for these two distinct purposes.</p>
<h4 id="alternatives-socially">Alternatives (socially)</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Instagram</strong>: I&rsquo;ve turned off suggested content<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, which only shows me
things from people I follow. As well as only use Instagram in the browser.
But this is imperfect as the Algorithm is terrible at showing me what I
want, and great at showing me what will keep me on the app as long as
possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Talk to your friends</strong>: It seems absurd that I have to even write this.
But everything Instagram promises in terms of social interaction, can be
done by talking to your friends.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask them how their trip was</li>
<li>Send them pictures of cool things that happened to you</li>
<li>Just like, be their friend</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="alternatives-photography">Alternatives (photography)</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://flickr.com">Flickr</a></strong>: I really like Flickr. It has somehow
survived the Algorithmization of social media. It is simple, serves as a
place to post my photos and looks at others whose work inspires me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>This site</strong>: I will likely add a portfolio section to show some of my
favorite work on this site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make projects</strong>: I am hoping to start making physical projects of cohesive
photos I take.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Read/view projects</strong>: Go to your library - they have loads of photo books
to check out. Specifically from old renowned photographers who you won&rsquo;t see
on the internet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reddit">Reddit</h3>
<p>The more I use Reddit, the more I think I should just stop. Redditors are a meme
for a reason, and you can get news and interact with communities of interest
(see Flickr above) in other places. In these alternatives I&rsquo;ll focus on the
link-aggregation nature of Reddit.</p>
<h4 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>An RSS feed</strong>: After reading
<a href="https://www.staygrounded.online/p/a-well-curated-feed-reader-is-a-wonderful?utm_source=publication-search">this article</a>
I have wanted to set up an RSS feed of things I would usually look for on
Reddit. If I do, I&rsquo;ll update this to reflect how that experience has been.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local new sites</strong>: I used Reddit a lot to see what was going on in my
local area. Luckily, this was solved in eternity past by <em>the newspaper</em>.
Unfortunately, here, they only circulate monthly but all have real websites
that stay up to date with local news.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="entertainment">Entertainment</h2>
<h3 id="youtube">YouTube</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much of a problem with comsumption-based entertainment. I think
that TV, movies, and even something like YouTube can have its place. I think
that the real problem, of which YouTube has also fallen into, is <em>passive</em>
consumption. With autoplay, shorts, Algorithm-driven suggestions, etc, it is
really easy to passively watch. These alternatives will focus on active
consumption instead.</p>
<h4 id="alternatives-1">Alternatives</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube">Freetube</a></strong>: This is a YouTube
client that allows you to turn off all suggestions. I have mine configured
to show the newest videos from channels I subscribe to. It does not show
shorts, and it does not show recommendations. It also, theoretically is more
private. I haven&rsquo;t done loads of reasearch on that, but currently YouTube is
the only thing tying me to Google. Unfortunately, it also seems to be capped
to 1080p playback, which is unfortunate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add channels to your RSS feed</strong>: I don&rsquo;t do this, namely because I don&rsquo;t
have an RSS feed, but I would love to get to a point where I have
RSS+something like youtube-dl<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> to watch videos locally.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="streaming-services">Streaming services</h3>
<p>I am currently dependent on Spotify for my music, and TV streaming services for
movies and TV. However, I would love to start buying physical copies of music,
tv, and movies. Though, that is extremely expensive, so who knows if I will do
it.</p>
<h2 id="shopping">Shopping</h2>
<h3 id="amazon">Amazon</h3>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like using Amazon, and honestly only get a few things there
periodically. I should probably cancel my Prime membership. Amazon is
anti-competitive, and treats their employees particularly bad. I would rather
not support a business like that.</p>
<h4 id="alternatives-2">Alternatives</h4>
<p><strong>Shop locally</strong>: This is the best option. When I have the option, I always try
to shop at a locally owner store.</p>
<p><strong>Shop at real stores</strong>: Sometimes local stores may not have what I want, in
that case I try to shop at a real store, even if it is a chain.</p>
<p><strong>Order from other online sources</strong>: If I can&rsquo;t buy something in person, I would
rather order from a different online store than Amazon. For example, I buy
camera gear almost exclusively from <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/">B&amp;H</a> (new)
and <a href="https://www.mpb.com/">MPB</a> (used).</p>
<h3 id="kindle">Kindle</h3>
<p>For the same reasons as Amazon</p>
<h4 id="alternatives-3">Alternatives</h4>
<p><strong>Real books</strong>: Your local library will literally give you books for free. Go
get them.</p>
<p><strong>Other E-Readers</strong>: I have a pocketbook E-Reader that I love, but any brand
that supports books <em>not</em> purchased through the Kindle store is great.</p>
<h3 id="misc-programs">Misc Programs</h3>
<p>Lots of things to put here, so I&rsquo;ll try and keep it short and sweet.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Adobe Lightroom</strong>: I really want to use
<a href="https://www.darktable.org/">Darktable</a> because its free, open-source, and
AI-free. But I haven&rsquo;t been able to get it to work well enough for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Windows</strong>: I use a Mac at home, but would really prefer to use Linux<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.
Apple definitely has its own anti-compete issues that I would rather not
support. However, Lightroom doesn&rsquo;t run on Linux, and Apple cares
significantly more about my privacy than Windows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>G-Mail</strong>: It&rsquo;s <em>so</em> easy to use a different email provider. Specifically,
I choose one I have to pay for<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, as they are much more likely to value my
privacy. Its also easy to set it up to use this domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google search</strong>: Google search has gotten worse, and they are adding AI
summaries which I am not interested in. I use
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com">duckduckgo</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VSCode</strong>: Microsoft classicly has a parasitic relationship with
open-source, and I expect the same for VSCode eventually. Neovim is perfect
for my use case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google Chrome</strong>: I use Firefox.</p>
</li>
</ul>
